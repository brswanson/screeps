### What is Screeps?
This repository is my attempt at creating an AI for the "MMO sandbox game for programmers": [Screeps](https://screeps.com/).

>"Screeps means “scripting creeps.” It’s an open-source sandbox MMO RTS game for programmers, wherein the core mechanic is programming your units’ AI. You control your colony by writing JavaScript which operate 24/7 in the single persistent real-time world filled by other players on par with you."

### My Screeps AI
So far only basic functionality is in place. Eventually I want the AI to at least be able to:

- Optimally harvest all rooms it exists in
- Expand to nearby rooms
- Assault nearby rooms
